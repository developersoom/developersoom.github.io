## [Udemy] React Testing with Jest and Enzyme 1

### 섹션 1: Introduction to Jest, Enzyme and TDD

**dir: demo**

**TDD = write test before we write the code**

1. write a shell version of  code (기능 안하는 function)
2. write the test (fail하는 test) - red part→ we want to see the test fail
3. failing test 가지고 write code to pass → green part 

**Why TDD ?** 

- 처음엔 effort가 많이 든다고 생각하지만 나중에 코드 수정 후에는 effort 없이 테스트를 다시 돌릴 수 있음
- 결국엔 더 나은 코드를 짜게 됨 (better organized code, plan before coding, fewer bugs, great code coverage)
    - Code Coverage is a measurement of how many lines/blocks/arcs of your code are executed while the automated tests are running.

**Jest**

`jest --watch` : rerun the test if a change is made (since the last commit)

- docs [https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)
- `toBeTruthy()` it will return true  ( ↔ `toBeFalsy()`)

**Enzyme (vs React DOM)** 

- creates virtual DOM for testing
- allows testing w/o a browser
- shallow rendering = render components only one level deep (render parent, but use placeholders for children)
- npm i --save-dev enzyme jest-enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
- docs - [https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)

    test("renders w/o crashing", () => {
      const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
      console.log(wrapper.debug())
    });

**Types of tests**

- unit test = test one piece of code (usually one function)
- integration test = how multiple units work together
- acceptance / end-to-end(E2E) test = how a user would interact with app

**Testing Goal** 

**#1 ease maintenance tests not having to rewrite tests when you refactor**

- Testing Behavior ⭕️
    - set initial state - simulate button click - check displayed count to see that it was incremented by one
- Testing Implementation 🚫
    - set initial state - simulate button click - check to see if particular function was called

—> testing implementation (function name) not behavior (display update) 

**#2 easy diagnosis of failing tests** 

- difficult to diagnose test 🚫
    - test that after entire process - if it fails, can't find what step was the problem / it needs further investigation
- easier to diagnose ⭕️
    - after each user action - test expected internal state change or test that a particular function was called  (→ testing implementation???) —> **trade off && balance**

**No snapshots** 

because 1) no TDD 2) brittle 3) difficult to diagnose 4) no intent
