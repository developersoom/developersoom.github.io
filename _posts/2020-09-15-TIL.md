   그냥 해도 되네...? 

3. Event Subscription

     - **Subscribe to Bot Events**. There are four events related to messages: `message.channels` (listens for messages in public channels), `message.groups` (listens for messages in private channels), `message.im` (listens for messages in the App Home/DM space), and `message.mpim` (listens for messages in multi-person DMs).

- `git init`
- `heroku login`
- `git init`
- `heroku create`
- `.gitignore` / gaa / gcmsg / gp
- 왜인지 verify 안됨... 



7. verify 하기

`npm i body-parser`

```
/* 슬랙 봇 */
const { App, ExpressReceiver} = require('@slack/bolt');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const port = process.env.PORT || 3030;

const receiver = new ExpressReceiver({ signingSecret: '2bd8a9b8c0f5b9462787b73c6d601d76' });

// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
receiver.router.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// parse application/json
receiver.router.use(bodyParser.json());

receiver.router.post('/slack/events', function (req, res) {
	const value = req.body.challenge;
	res.send(value);
});

```



package.json

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
```



8. heroku server get 스케줄러

https://cron-job.org/en/members/

-  create cronjob

```
// Other web requests are methods on receiver.router
receiver.router.get('/cronjob', (req, res) => {
 // You're working with an express req and res now.
 return res.send(true);
});
```
